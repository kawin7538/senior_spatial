Description for TestCase

*********************************

Iteration through value precise
    - all the inputs will be iterately with precise value from 100, 99, 95, 90, 75, 50 percent

Structure of .in files

    - Each .in file consists of 2 line. 
        - First line contains four parameters as follow: layer depth for preparing data, layer depth for filter, filter property (name, etc.), and percent adjust (0-100) that defined for random interval.
        - Second line consists of n classified values for n nodes in map, input as "high" and "low".
